          The following terms and conditions (“T&amp;C’s”) constitute a binding
          agreement between you (“You”) and Ezyone Digital Systems Pvt Limited
          (“Eg Paid”). By using Eg-Paid’s services, you agree to be bound by
          these T&amp;C’s.
        </center>
        <p>1. Working Procedure</p>
        <p>
          Eg Paid provides its services in the following manner: First Step: Eg
          Paid becomes the Business Correspondent (BC) of Banks / FIs. Second
          Step: Eg Paid appoints a BC agents (typically a retail merchant) for
          doing Domestic Money Transfer business. The BC Agent deposits initial
          capital (for example Rs. 5,000/-) in Eg Paid’s Bank account to start
          the business. Eg Paid provides equivalent Trading balance (i.e Rs.
          5,000/- in this example) in the form of ‘E-money’ to retailer on Eg
          Paid’s portal. Third Step: Eg Paid appoints Distributors (field boys)
          for collecting cash from merchant’s outlets. A Walk-in customer comes
          to the BC agent’s (Merchant) outlet and gives cash (e.g Rs. 4,000/-+
          transfer fee of 1% - Rs. 40/-) to be transferred to his family
          member’s bank account in his village. Merchant collects Rs.
          4,040/-feeds in the mobile number of the walk-in customer and bank
          details of the beneficiary on Eg Paid’s portal and then sends a
          request for transferring Rs 4,000/-. Eg Paid transfers Rs. 4,000/ from
          its settlement bank account to beneficiary’s bank account. Eg Paid
          debits the Trading balance (e-money) of Merchant on its portal with
          Rs. 4,000/-+ fee of Rs. 40/-). Hence retailer’s trade balance now
          reduces to Rs. 960/- (i.e. Rs. 5,000/ – Rs. 4,040/-). Eg Paid’s
          appointed Distributor (field boy) goes to Merchant’s shop, collects
          cash of Rs. 4,040/- and deposits in Eg Paid’s bank account. Eg Paid
          reconciles it and gives e-money of Rs. 4,040/- to Merchant and his
          trade balance again becomes Rs. 5,000/-. He can now serve customers
          the next day
        </p>
